# Test Instrumented Firecracker Binary (#4215):

This issue asked for a test that verifies Firecracker emits trace-level logs when instrumented using the log-instrument crate. The goal was to confirm that instrumentation works not only on simple examples but on the actual Firecracker binary itself.

We wrote a Python integration test that spawns a Firecracker microVM with log-level=Trace and logging properly configured. Once the VM is running, the test performs a meaningful, known operation (in our case ping 8.8.8.8) from inside the guest to trigger some sort of network activity. Afterward, the test inspects the logs generated by the Firecracker process and asserts that trace-level instrumentation markers (e.g., >>) are present, confirming that the binary has been instrumented successfully.
